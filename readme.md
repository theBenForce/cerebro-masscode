# cerebro-plugin-boilerplate

## Why this and not create-cerebro-plugin?

Create-Cerebro-Plugin is outdated and uses dependencies with `vulnerabilities`. This template uses esbuild, much faster and customizable through the esbuild.config.js file.

You can develop in Typescript by changing a few lines of code and adding a multitude of esbuild plugins.
